Facial Emotion Recognition using OpenCV and DeepfaceThis project implements real-time facial emotion detection using the Deepface library and OpenCV. It captures video from the webcam, detects faces, and predicts the emotions associated with each face. The emotion labels are displayed on the frames in real-time.Dependencies* Deepface: A deep learning library for facial emotion detection.* OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library for video and image processing.Installation1. Clone the repository:bashgit clone https://github.com/TUSHARS7070/Semester_5/tree/72587c4f3256bef877f9994457f954bed1682cf6/ComputerVision/Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepfacecd Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface2. Install the required dependencies:bashpip install -r requirements.txtOr install them individually:bashpip install deepface tf_keras opencv-python3. Download the Haar cascade XML file for face detection from here and place it in the project directory.Running the Project1. Execute the Python script:bashCopy codepython facial_emotion_recognition.py2. The webcam will open, and the program will start detecting faces and displaying emotions in real-time.3. Press the 'q' key to exit the program.
